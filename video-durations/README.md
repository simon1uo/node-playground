# Video Duration 

This is a simple script that calculates the duration of a video file. It uses the `ffprobe` command-line tool to get the duration of the video file and then formats it as a human-readable string.

To use this script, you will need to have `ffprobe` installed on your system. You can download it from the [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

And, create a directory named 'videos' and put your video files in it.
